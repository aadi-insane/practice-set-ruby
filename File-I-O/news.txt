NEW DELHI: The government is exploring options to respond to US President Donald Trumpâ€™s decision to impose a 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods, but has ruled out any immediate retaliation, Bloomberg reported.

The government is also considering steps to maintain trade relations, including increasing imports from the US, but is not planning any new defence purchases, according to people familiar with the matter cited by Bloomberg.

India has told US officials that it is not interested in acquiring the F-35 stealth fighter jets, despite continued American efforts to expand defence exports to New Delhi, Bloomberg reported. 

The Modi government is unlikely to approve any major new defence deals with the US in the near future, the report said.
